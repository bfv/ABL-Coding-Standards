# Concatenation of Strings

For two Strings it is ok to combine them using a “+” when both arguments are variables (and not constants) and it is either guaranteed that none of the strings is unknown value or it is o.k. that the resulting string is the unknown value. 

As soon as a third String is concatenated developers should consider to combine the three strings using the SUBSTITUTE function.
