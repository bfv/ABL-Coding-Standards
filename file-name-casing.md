# File Name Casing

Names of files with the extensions .i / .p / .w start with a lower cased letter and after that camel case the words.

All temp-table .i files have to be prefixed with “tt” or “e” for example “ttCustomer.i”.

All dataset .i files have to be prefixed with “ds” for example “dsCustomer”.
